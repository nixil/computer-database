This is a classic CRUD application, backed by a JDBC database. It demonstrates:

- Accessing a JDBC database, using Squeryl.
- Achieving, table pagination and CRUD forms.
- Integrating with a CSS framework (Twitter Bootstrap ).
- db evolution is disabled. Use squeryl's schema generator to create/drop db, use json as test data file.
- play version 2.0.1 , squeryl version 0.9.5

Twitter Bootstrap requires a different form layout to the default one that the Play 2.0 form helper generates, so this application also provides an example of integrating a custom form input constructor.
